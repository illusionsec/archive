API-ATTACK-SYSTEM
========================

No dependencies (Just perl and PHP).
Simple to setup
Uses Sockets


*Things being added in future:
Configuration files
Secure Connections
Listening on both sides


Currently the Attack System is 100% working!
Thanks to zap for the php frontend of the api.

The files allow an Virtually unlimited amount of attack servers to be added into a cluster at a time.
Please Specify the IP's and port of each connection in client.pl
Please Set the port in server.pl to the one in client.pl

Adding Attacks is easy, just edit the server.pl before distributing to your attacks.
